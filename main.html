	 <h1>Why I want to become a developer?</h1>
  <p>
    I want to become a software developer because I enjoy solving problems, creating useful applications, 
    and turning ideas into reality through code. Technology excites me as it keeps evolving, and I am 
    motivated to keep learning and contributing to innovative projects that make peopleâ€™s lives easier. 
    Being a developer allows me to combine creativity with logic, which makes this path both challenging 
    and rewarding for me.
